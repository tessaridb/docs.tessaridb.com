//! Putting `content/` into the store.
//!
//! # Why this rebuilds rather than reconciles
//!
//! The ingest deletes every page, fragment, section and edge and writes them
//! again. A reconciling ingest — work out what changed, write only that — is the
//! obvious improvement and is the wrong trade here: it has to be right about
//! deletions and renames to avoid leaving a page that no longer exists in the
//! tree, and it would be exercised only on the rare edit while the rebuild is
//! exercised on every deploy. A rebuild of a few hundred pages is a second.
//!
//! It runs at start, before the server takes traffic, so the window where the
//! store is half-written is a window with no readers in it.
//!
//! An editor changing one page does **not** come through here — see `write`.
//! Both write the same records through the same two helpers below; what differs
//! is the unit.
