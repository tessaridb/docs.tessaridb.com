//! What the binary was asked to do.
//!
//! Parsed by hand rather than by a crate. Three verbs and five options do not
//! earn a dependency, and the whole surface is asserted below — which is more
//! than a derive would give, because what can be wrong here is not the shape of
//! the flags but which defaults apply and where they come from.
//!
//! # Why the password is environment-only
//!
//! There is no `--password`. A password on a command line is in `ps`, in the
//! shell's history, and in the container's inspect output — three places nobody
//! meant to put it. `DOCS_PASSWORD` is one place, and it is the one an
//! orchestrator already knows how to fill.

docs — the documentation site for TessariDB

  docs check                     read content/ and report what is wrong with it
  docs ingest                    replace what the store holds with content/
  docs serve                     serve the API, seeding the store only if empty
  docs publish --to <url>        write content/ to a running site, over its API
  docs archive --as <version>    keep the site as it stands as that release

The store owns the content. content/ is where it is written and reviewed, and
what an empty store is seeded from — but pages are also edited through the API,
so a populated store is the answer and is never rebuilt from disk unless asked.

Options
  --content <dir>    where the Markdown lives          (default: content)
  --at <host:port>   the node's wire address           (default: 127.0.0.1:7654)
  --namespace <ns>   the documentation version         (default: v0_0_3_alpha)
  --bind <host:port> where the API listens, serve only (default: 127.0.0.1:8080)
  --ingest           serve: replace what the store holds first. Destructive.
  --to <url>         publish: the site to write to, e.g. https://docs.example
  --user <name>      publish: the account to sign in as
  --apply            publish: write. Without it, publish only says what it would
  --prune            publish: also remove pages the site has and content/ lacks
  --as <version>     archive: the release label, e.g. 0.32.0-beta
  --into <ns>        archive: the namespace to keep it in (default: v + the
                     label with . and - as _, e.g. v0_32_0_beta)
  --help             this
  --version          the version this was built from

Environment
  TESSARIDB_ADDRESS  the default for --at
  DOCS_NAMESPACE     the default for --namespace
  DOCS_BIND          the default for --bind
  DOCS_CONTENT       the default for --content
  DOCS_USER          the store user that seeds and ingests (needs to write)
  DOCS_PASSWORD      that user's password
  DOCS_READER_USER   the store user the public reads run as — a viewer
  DOCS_READER_PASSWORD  that user's password
  DOCS_SITE          the default for --to
  DOCS_PUBLISH_USER  the default for --user
  DOCS_PUBLISH_PASSWORD the publishing account's password, for publish

A store with no users is open; declaring the first one closes it, and a closed
store refuses anonymous sessions for reads as well as writes. So a deployed
site needs DOCS_READER_USER, and it should name a viewer: the store is then
what refuses a write on the public path, rather than this server's routing.

The address is a bare host:port. There is no URL scheme, because the protocol
is not carried over HTTP. --to is different and is a URL, because that one is
HTTP and needs to say whether it is TLS.

publish and ingest do the same job from opposite sides. ingest runs beside the
store and replaces everything it holds; publish runs anywhere, writes only what
differs, and removes nothing unless asked. A deployment seeds with ingest and is
maintained with publish.

archive copies the site from --namespace into a namespace of its own and lists
it there as a release the site can show. It declares a namespace, so it runs as
a store-wide user. Archiving a label again replaces what it held.
