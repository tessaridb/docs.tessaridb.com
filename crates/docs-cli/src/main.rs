//! The site's binary.
//!
//! ```text
//! docs check      read content/ and say what is wrong with it
//! docs serve      serve the API, seeding the store only if it is empty
//! docs ingest     replace what the store holds with content/. Destructive.
//! ```
//!
//! # Why `check` needs no node
//!
//! Nearly everything that goes wrong with a documentation tree goes wrong on
//! disk: an unclosed front-matter fence, a directory that never said what it is
//! called, a page filed under a section it is not in. None of that needs a
//! database to find, so `check` does not open one — which makes it a thing CI
//! can run on a pull request without standing a node up first.
//!
//! # Why `serve` applies the schema and `ingest` does too
//!
//! Both, every time. Every definition carries `IF NOT EXISTS`, so applying it
//! to a store that already has it is a few statements and no change; the
//! alternative is remembering whether this deployment has run before, which is
//! state nobody wants to keep and everybody gets wrong on the fresh host folder
//! the containers mount.
//!
//! # Who owns the content, and why `serve` does not rebuild
//!
//! **The store owns it.** `content/` is where the corpus is written and reviewed
//! and it is what an empty store is seeded from, but once a page is in the store
//! the store is the answer — because pages are also edited through the API, by
//! whoever the store lets write, and a restart that rebuilt from disk would
//! throw those edits away without saying so. A write surface whose writes do not
//! survive a deployment is not a write surface.
//!
//! So `serve` seeds **only an empty store**, and rebuilding from disk over a
//! populated one is `--ingest`, or the `ingest` command: destructive, and asked
//! for out loud. This is the same reasoning the language applies to
//! `DELETE FROM page` — the destructive reading is never the default one.
