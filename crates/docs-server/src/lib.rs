//! The site's HTTP surface.
//!
//! Three reads anyone may make, and writes for whoever the store lets write.
//! The server holds no content and caches none: every route is a statement
//! against TessariDB, which is the point of the site.
//!
//! # Two questions, answered in two different places
//!
//! **Who is asking** is this API's question, and it is answered against the
//! `account` and `token` tables: a person signs in with a password and is given
//! a token that works for a day. A person is not a database user.
//!
//! **What may travel on this connection** stays the store's question. The store
//! holds two service accounts and neither is a person: the read routes run as a
//! `viewer` and the write routes as an `editor`. So a routing mistake that sent
//! a write down the read path would still be refused — by the database, with
//! "a viewer may not write", whatever this server believed it was doing.
//!
//! Keeping the second half is the whole reason the first half is safe to add.
//! An API that authenticated its own users *and* held one all-powerful database
//! connection would have exactly one thing standing between a reader and a
//! write, and it would be this code.
//!
//! # A connection per request
//!
//! Each request opens its own connection to the node. That is deliberate for
//! now: a connection **is** a session in this protocol — `USE NAMESPACE` stays in
//! force on it, and so do credentials — so a pool shared between an anonymous
//! reader and a signed-in editor would be a pool where identity leaks between
//! requests. Pooling per identity is the eventual answer; it is not worth its
//! complexity before there is a measurement saying so.
