 * The search box's route.

 * A proxy, and deliberately nothing more. Its reason to exist is that the
 * documentation API sits on an internal network in the deployment, so the
 * browser cannot reach it — this runs on the server that can.
 *
 * It does no ranking. The order is the store's, out of `search::score` over the
 * one indexed field, and reordering it here would replace a ranking that
 * measures against the whole collection with one that measures against twenty
 * rows.
