 * word, you recognise the page, you go. This is for the other case: not knowing
 * which page holds a thing, and needing to read the passages to tell. A
 * dropdown is the wrong shape for that. It holds a handful of hits, it covers
 * the page it is searching, and on a phone it covers all of it.
 *
 * Being a page rather than a bigger dropdown buys three things a dropdown
 * cannot have: the query is in the URL, so a search can be linked, shared and
 * gone back to; the back button returns to the results instead of to an empty
 * box; and the results have room to show enough of each passage to be judged.
 *
 * Rendered on the server. The ranking is the store's own index — the same
 * index, over the same fragments, that the header box reads.
