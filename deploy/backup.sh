# Takes a snapshot of the running store, checks it, and keeps the last few.
#
# A snapshot is every live record at one moment (`.tessarisnap`). It is the
# backup from engine 0.18.0-beta on, because the node now keeps only the newest
# 100 000 records of each log and a pruned log cannot be copied whole.
# `BACKUP STATE;` is a statement the running node answers, which is why nothing
# has to stop for this.
#
# # It needs a store-wide account, and for a week it did not have one
#
# `BACKUP` reads every record in every namespace, so it has no tenancy to check
# and its subject is the **store**. An owner scoped to one database is refused
# with `"owner" holds one database, and this statement's subject is the whole
# store`. That is exactly what this deployment had until 2026-09-02: the store
# had been bootstrapped by a script that declared a database-scoped owner, and
# it could not be repaired in place — a scoped owner may not declare a wider
# user and a closed store has no anonymous session.
#
# It was repaired by rebuilding: a fresh store whose first user the engine
# itself declares from `TESSARIDB_INITIAL_USER` (which has no `ON`, so it owns
# the store), then a republish of `content/`. Q-DOCS-44.
#
# **If this script ever starts failing that way again, do not paper over it.**
# It means a store was bootstrapped without a store-wide owner, and the same
# store also cannot declare a namespace or be repaired. The fallback that needs
# no account at all is to stop the node and open the store directly:
#
#   docker compose ... stop db
#   docker run --rm --user 0:0 -v "$STORE:/store" -v "$INTO:/out" \
#     tessaridb/tessaridb:0.18.0-beta /store/store --backup /out/manual.tessarisnap
#   docker compose ... start db
#
# Two halves in two places, and not by preference: `xxd` is not in the database
# image and the engine binary is not on the host. So the node is asked inside the
# container, the hex it answers with is decoded here, and the file is checked by
# the engine again over a read-only mount.

# for two nights the node wrote a good log, the check refused to read it, and
